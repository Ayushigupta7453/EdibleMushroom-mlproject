# EdibleMushroom-mlproject
This is a beginner ml project based on decision tree algorithm. This project also uses XG boost for best split.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Suppose you are starting a company that grows and sells wild mushrooms.
Since not all mushrooms are edible, you'd like to be able to tell whether a given mushroom is edible or poisonous based on it's physical attributes.

-> For this project small dataset is created for which image is added of both normal data and encoded data in asset folder.
